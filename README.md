John Conway's "Game Of Life" is considered a no-player game. It runs in a cell/node system where each cell/node has two states, being alive or dead(on or off, true or false). Live nodes have the ability to give birth if a dead cell is next to three live neighbors. Live nodes can also die, live nodes with less than two neighbors or four+ neighbors will die. In other words, each live node will remain alive if it has two or three live neighbors.

Life:
    - Must have two or three live neighbors

Death:
    - Less than two neighbors
    - Four and more neighbors

Birth:
    - Dead cells next to exactly three neighbors
